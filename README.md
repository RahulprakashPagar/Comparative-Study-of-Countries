## ⚙️ Workflow and Methods

### 1️⃣ Data Preparation
- Imported datasets from Excel into Tableau.  
- Cleaned and standardized data formats (year, country, financial indicators, and insurance metrics).  
- Joined and blended the datasets (`Global Financial Development Database - Jul2018.xlsx` and `Insurance Sample Dataset.xlsx`) using country and year as key fields.  
- Created calculated fields for growth rates, ratios, and performance indices.  
- Ensured data consistency by handling nulls and aligning currencies for accurate visualizations.

### 2️⃣ Data Modeling and Metrics
- Developed relationships between economic indicators and insurance performance metrics.  
- Modeled KPIs such as:  
  - **GDP Growth Rate**  
  - **Insurance Premium Growth**  
  - **Claim-to-Premium Ratio**  
  - **Bank Efficiency (Cost-to-Income)**  
  - **Credit Availability (Private Sector Credit % of GDP)**  
- Added parameters and filters for region, country, and year selection to enable dynamic dashboard interaction.

### 3️⃣ Dashboard Design
- Designed intuitive Tableau dashboards with minimalistic, KPI-centric layouts.  
- Created multiple views:  
  - **Global Financial Overview Dashboard** — highlights GDP, credit growth, and financial inclusion metrics across continents.  
  - **Insurance Market Dashboard** — visualizes claims, premiums, and customer segmentation trends.  
  - **Comparative Insights Dashboard** — allows users to compare countries or regions across multiple years.  
- Used Tableau features like:  
  - Filters and Parameters for interactivity  
  - Calculated Fields for dynamic KPIs  
  - Dual-axis charts for GDP vs Insurance Premium correlation  
  - Trend lines, maps, and bar charts for visual storytelling

### 4️⃣ Insights and Key Findings
- **Positive Correlation:** Countries with higher financial development indices also tend to have more mature insurance markets.  
- **Emerging Markets:** Regions such as Asia and South America showed rapid insurance premium growth over the analyzed period.  
- **Risk and Claims:** The claim-to-premium ratio is higher in developing countries, indicating potential underwriting inefficiencies.  
- **Financial Inclusion:** Several countries with improving credit access still lag in insurance penetration, highlighting untapped opportunities.  
- **Top Performers:** Economies like the U.S., U.K., Japan, and Germany maintain high efficiency scores across both banking and insurance sectors.
